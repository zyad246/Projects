# Volatility Forecasting in South Africa

This code performs various technical tasks related to retrieving, analyzing, and modeling stock data for the ticker symbol "MTNOY". Here is a technical description of the code's functionalities and steps:

## 1. Importing Libraries

The code imports necessary libraries and modules such as pandas, requests, sqlite3, joblib, glob, arch, matplotlib, and numpy. These libraries provide functionality for data manipulation, API communication, database interaction, model building, and visualization.

## 2. Retrieving Stock Data

The code constructs a URL to access the Alpha Vantage API and retrieve daily time series data for the "MTNOY" stock. It specifies parameters such as the ticker symbol, output size, data type, and API key. The code uses the `requests` library to send a GET request to the API URL and receives a JSON response containing the stock data.

## 3. Data Processing

The code processes the JSON response data to extract relevant information. It extracts the ticker symbol from the metadata section of the response. The code then converts the stock data into a pandas DataFrame, performing data manipulation and formatting as necessary. The processed data is stored in a DataFrame for further analysis.

## 4. Storing Data in a Database

The code interacts with a SQLite database to store the MTNOY stock data. It establishes a connection with the database and creates a table to insert the stock data using SQL queries.

## 5. Analyzing Stock Data

The code retrieves the data from the database and performs analysis tasks such as calculating returns, volatility, and plotting the time series of returns using the `matplotlib` library.

## 6. GARCH Modeling

The code prepares the data for GARCH modeling by splitting it into a training set. It builds and trains a GARCH model using the `arch` library. The GARCH model is a popular choice for modeling financial time series data with volatility clustering.

## 7. Model Evaluation

The code evaluates the GARCH model by calculating evaluation metrics such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

## 8. Documentation

The code includes a README file that provides an overview of the code's functionalities and explains the steps involved in its execution. The README file serves as documentation to guide users and provide insights into the code's purpose and usage.

Please note that the code relies on additional modules, functions, and classes. The specific functionality and implementation details of these modules and functions are not provided in this readme.
